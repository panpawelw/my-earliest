My first attempts at Java programming. Demonstrates grasp of basic general programming and Java concepts, like variables, arrays, collections, loops, control flow statements, classes, methods, console input and output and file operations. 

Some simple games and programs:

- Guessing numbers #1 - user has to guess, using console input, a number randomly generated by the program.

- Lottery - pick 6 lottery numbers and let's see if they match numbers drawn by the program.

- Guessing numbers #2 - this program will guess a number chosen by you in 10 steps or less.

- Dice - dice roll simulator. Enter an expression describing how many dice of what type with optional modifier.
		 This program will parse the expression, simulate the roll and tell you the result.

- Most popular words - scan chosen websites using jsoup, save a list of all words in headlines to a file,
                       make a list of 10 most frequent words and save it to another file.
