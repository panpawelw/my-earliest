My first attempts at Java programming. Demonstrates grasp of basic general programming and Java concepts.

Some simple games and programs:

- Guessing numbers #1 - user has to guess a number randomly generated by the program using console input.

- Lottery - pick 6 lottery numbers and let's see if they match numbers drawn by the program

- Guessing numbers #2 - this program will guess a number chosen by you in 10 steps or less.

- Dice - dice throwing simulator.

- Most popular words - scan chosen websites using jsoup, save a list of all words in headlines to a file,
                       make a list of 10 most frequent words and save them to another file.
